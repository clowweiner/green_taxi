Input: 2016 green taxi data with pickup and dropoff location.

Output: D3 application that visualizes pickup/dropoff location by
dividing City into hexagonal areas. The hexagonal areas will be
color-coded based on the volumed of activity in that area in a given
hour.

Work in R:
Aggregate taxi data into hexagonal bins by hour. Will create a data
frame with the hour, center of hexagon (x,y), number of events
(pickup/dropoff), and color associated with the number of pickups.

Hour, X, Y, Number, Color

Steps
- Divide City into hexagonal areas using shapefile of the
city. Example: http://strimas.com/spatial/hexagonal-grids/
- Convert taxi coordinates into SpatialPointsDataFrame
- Use over() function to return intersection of pickup/dropoff and
hexagonal areas
- For each hour get frequency of pickup/dropoffs by hexagonal
area
- Convert frequencies into colors
